# Automated-Web-scanner
This project develops an automated vulnerability detection system for web applications and networks. It identifies threats like SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF, and SSRF while performing network reconnaissance, including port scanning and OS detection. The tool automates security testing, generates detailed reports, and enhances efficiency using multithreading and WAF evasion. Designed as a lightweight, open-source solution, it offers a cost-effective alternative to traditional security tools.
